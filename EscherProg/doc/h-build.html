<h1>Building GeomLab</h1>

<p>The GeomLab system consists of the programming environment,
  implemented as a Java Swing application (geomlab), an abstract
  machine for running programs in the GeomLab language that is
  implemented by an interpreter written in Java (funbase), a
  collection of plug-in features for the language (plugins), and a
  compiler from the GeomLab language to the abstract machine.  The
  scanner and parser for the language are implemented in Java as part
  of the funbase package, but the translation phase is implemented in
  the language itself, and the build process therefore requires a
  bootstrap copy of the object code for the compiler.</p>

<p>The complete build process goes as follows:<p>

<ol>
<li>Compile the Java source, using a command such as<br>
    <code>javac funbase/*.java geomlab/*.java plugins/*.java</code>
<li>Use the bootstrap code to compile the compiler:<br>
    <code>java geomlab.RunScript -b boot.txt compiler.txt 
	&gt;stage1.boot</code>
<li>Use the compiler to compile itself:<br>
    <code>java geomlab.RunScript -b stage1.boot compiler.txt
    &gt;stage2.boot</code>
<li>Use the compiler to compile itself again:<br>
    <code>java geomlab.RunScript -b stage2.boot compiler.txt
    &gt;stage3.boot</code><br>
    The files <code>stage2.boot</code>
    and <code>stage3.boot</code> should be identical.
<li>Make a session image containing the compiler and the prelude:<br>
    <code>java geomlab.RunScript -b stage2.boot prelude.txt
    -e '_dump("geomlab.gls")'</code>
</ol>

<p>Now it should be possible to run the GeomLab application
with <code>java geomlab.GeomLab</code>.  By default, this initially
loads the session image <code>geomlab.gls</code> prepared above.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, it is not necessary to go through stages (2),
  (3) and (4) of the build process shown here: the bootstrap
  file <code>boot.txt</code> can be used directly in place
  of <code>stage2.boot</code> in stage (5).  
  However, if there have been changes to the compiler, the whole
  process is necessary in order to get the system into a stable state.</p>

<p>There are two object code formats used in the process above: the
  file <code>boot.txt</code> is in a special, textual format that is
  capable of storing only a limited number of kinds of value, and the
  final image <code>geomlab.gls</code> is in a binary format that uses
  Java serialization and can store all kinds of value.  The textual
  format is used to get round problems with serialization when the
  underlying Java classes are subject to change.</p>
